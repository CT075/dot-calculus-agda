# Dependent Object Types (Agda)

The DOT (Dependent Object Types) calculus by [Amin et al. (2016)](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/215280/files/paper_1.pdf)
is an ongoing effort to formalize the semantics of Scala, particularly abstract
type members and path-dependent types.

This repository contains Agda translations of [https://github.com/amaurremi/dot-calculus](Rapoport et al.'s work)
on the subject, particularly their [simple proof](https://github.com/amaurremi/dot-calculus)
of the calculus' soundness.
